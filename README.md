# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize asked Omar and I to create a new summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I then had to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. At the end, there is a written report to help summarize how the data differs by city type and how PyBer can use these differences by decision-makers. 

## Results

In this analysis, I created a new summary DataFrame based on the 3 city types (urban, suburban, and rural). Urban cities make up the biggest portion of the total fares at 62.7%, but have the lowest average fare per ride and driver. Rural cities, on the other hand, make up the smallest portion of the total fares at 6.8%, but have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

Both rural and suburban cities have more drivers than rides, which likely plays a big role in the higher average fare per ride and driver compared to rural cities. Urban is the only city type in which the avearage fare per driver is lower than the average fare per ride due to the excess supply of drivers vs the demand for rides. The multiple-line chart below shows that urban cities have the highest total fares from January 1st through April 28th in 2019, with suburban cities coming in second, and rural cities at the bottom.

## Summary 
Based on the results of the analysis, here are 3 business recommendations to help address any disparities among the city types:
1. Drivers near the outskirts of urban cities should be incentivized to pick up rides in rural and suburban areas. This will help lower driver supply in urban cities and close the gap between supply and demand.
2. PyBer should look to increase total drivers in both rural and suburban cities. Not only is this affecting average fare prices, it could also cause demand to decrease in the long run as customers look to competing companies for available drivers.
3. Drivers in urban cities may offer their services to competing companies due to lower fares. PyBer will need to look into marketing strategies to help increase customer demand, which will then increase average fares for the drivers.
